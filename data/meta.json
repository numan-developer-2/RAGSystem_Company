Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI framework that combines: 1. **Information Retrieval**: Finding relevant documents or passages 2. **Language Generation**: Using LLMs to generate natural language responses ## How This System Works ### Document Processing - Your documents are split into smaller chunks - Each chunk is converted to a vector embedding - Embeddings are stored in a FAISS index for fast retrieval ### Query Processing - Your question is converted to an embedding - Similar document chunks are retrieved - Retrieved context is sent to an LLM - The LLM generates an answer based on the context ## Getting Started 1. Add your documents to the `docs/` folder 2."
